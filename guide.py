"""Stage 3: Synthesize a Chicago local government beat guide using Claude.

Reads extracted_articles.json, builds a structured brief for each article,
then asks Claude to synthesize a comprehensive beat guide organized by theme
with inline citations linking to the original articles.

Usage:
    uv run python guide.py \\
        --input extracted_articles.json \\
        [--model claude-sonnet-4-6] \\
        [--output chicago_local_gov_guide.md]

Requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable or:
    uv run llm keys set anthropic

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a veteran Chicago investigative editor with 20 years covering City Hall, the
Cook County courthouse, and Chicago's neighborhoods. You are writing a beat guide to help a
journalist new to Chicago local government quickly get up to speed.

Your goal is NOT to catalog or summarize every article. Your goal is to SYNTHESIZE — to find
the patterns, identify the fault lines, name the power players, and point reporters toward
the stories that matter most. Be opinionated. Draw connections between issues. Highlight
contradictions and tensions. Tell the reporter what they need to watch.

Write in clear, direct prose. Use inline citations in the format ([Headline](URL)) when
referencing specific reporting. Every factual claim about an event should be anchored to a
specific article citation."""

GUIDE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Below is a corpus of Chicago Sun-Times articles about local government published in early 2026.
Each article includes an AI-generated summary, key people, organizations, locations, issues, and a URL.

Using this corpus, write a comprehensive beat guide for a reporter new to covering Chicago local government.
Structure your guide with these six sections:

## The Political Landscape
Map the key power centers: Who is Mayor Brandon Johnson and what are his priorities? Who are
the most influential aldermen and what factions exist in the City Council? What are the major
fault lines — between the mayor and the council, between City Hall and Springfield, between
neighborhoods and downtown? Ground every claim in the articles below.

## Major Issues and Ongoing Battles
Cover 4-6 of the most significant policy issues appearing in the corpus. For each issue:
- What's at stake for Chicago residents
- Which officials or factions are on each side
- What has happened recently (cite specific articles)
- What questions remain unanswered or unresolved

## Key People to Know
Profile 8-12 recurring figures from the corpus: their official role, their political position,
their agenda, and why a reporter needs to track them. Be specific — not just "an alderman"
but "the 47th Ward alderman who is blocking the mayor's zoning package."

## Follow the Money
Identify the financial angles in this coverage: budget decisions, TIF district fights, contract
awards, tax policy, development deals, fines and settlements. Where is money moving and who
controls it?

## Stories Worth Chasing
Based on gaps, tensions, and threads in this corpus, identify 4-6 stories that aren't fully
told yet. What questions does this coverage raise but not answer? What patterns suggest a
bigger story? What watchdog angles are hiding in plain sight?

## Quick Reference: Who Does What
List the key government bodies and departments that appear in this coverage with a one-sentence
explanation of their role and why a reporter should know them.
